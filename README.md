# AF-Detection-Single-Lead-ECG
Deep learning-based Atrial Fibrillation detection using single-lead ECG signals. Includes preprocessing (denoising, beat segmentation) and a CNN - BiLSTM model to capture spatial ECG features and temporal rhythm patterns. Designed for accurate beat-level AF classification toward wearable cardiac monitoring.
